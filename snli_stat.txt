The whole data set including train/dev/test sets.

sent1: 
max length: 78	mean length: 12.9

sent2:
max length: 56	mean length: 7.4


After cleaning the sample with label "-", I get 549367 train samples, 9842 dev samples and 9824 test samples.

vocabulary size: 57323 (including padidng 0)
Using pre-trained word embeddings as the initial values of embedding matrix, I get a hit rate of 0.456


warning: word dropout is not suitable for SNLI data set.
When using it, the test accuracy is only 0.654.
When discarding it , the test accuracy is 0.755.
